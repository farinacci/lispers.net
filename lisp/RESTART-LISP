# RESTART-LISP
#
# Call ./RUN-LISP and ./STOP-LISP under sudo. Pass parameters that RUN-LISP
# requires. This is required because STOP-LISP kills all python processes
# and RUN-LISP runs python processes, so we can't call STOP-LISP inside of
# RUN-LISP. Calls must be done serially. When STOP-LISP returns, it 
# guarantees all processes are gone.
