This directory contains all the source code and support files needed to run the
lispers.net LISP subsystem.

The lispers.net subsystem contains the following general functionality:

(1) A full-featured LISP control-plane written in python 2.7.
(2) A full-featured LISP data-plane written in python 2.7.
(3) A full-featured LISP data-plane written in golang.

The LISP component functionality includes:

(1) xTR functions ITR, ETR, and RTR for IPv4/IPv6 unicast and multicast EIDs
    and/or RLOCs.
(2) Mapping system functions Map-Resolver (MR) and Map-Server (MS).
(3) Mapping Database Transport LISP-DDT (DDT).
(4) Support for LISP-NAT is used for LISP-to-non-LISP Interworking.

To compile the go files, run "./build-xtr" from the lisp/ subdirectory. Then
build/make-release.py will pick up binary file 'lisp-xtr' to package it into
the tarball it creates.

Prebuilt images are created by the repo owner/admin and will be placed in
directories build/release-<xx> (where "<xx>" is the release number) and a
symlink 'latest' will point to the latest release directory. File
build/latest/lispers.net.tgz can always be used to get the most recent built
tarball independent of specifying the release number. This is useful for doing
Docker builds.
