This directory contains a set of lisp.config configuration template files you
can use for deploying different types of LISP network components. Where you
see angle brackets ("<>") in any lisp.config file, you should replace with real
values relevant to your network environment.

This directory also contains how-to guides on first-time installation of the
lispers.net software as well as how to use the apps in the apps/ directory.

The lisp.config.example file contains all lispers.net command documentation 
and can also be found by clicking the "Command Documentation" button on the
lispers.net landing page.
