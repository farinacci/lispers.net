1.  Introduction

   The LISP architecture and protocols [RFC6830] introduces two new
   numbering spaces, Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs) and Routing Locators
   (RLOCs) which are intended to replace most use of IP addresses on the
   Internet.  To provide flexibility for current and future
   applications, these values can be encoded in LISP control messages
   using a general syntax that includes Address Family Identifier (AFI)
   [RFC1700].

   The length of the value field is implicit in the type of address that
   follows.  For AFI 17, a Distinguished Name can be encoded.  A name
   can be a variable length field so the length cannot be determined
   solely from the AFI value 17.  This draft defines a termination
   character, an 8-bit value of 0 to be used as a string terminator so
   the length can be determined.

Internet-Draft      LISP Distinguished Name Encoding       November 2021


   LISP Distinguished Names are useful when encoded either in EID-
   records or RLOC-records in LISP control messages.  As EIDs, they can
   be registered in the mapping system to find resources, services, or
   simply used as a self-documenting feature that accompany other
   address specific EIDs.  As RLOCs, Distinguished Names, along with
   RLOC specific addresses and parameters, can be used as labels to
   identify equipment type, location, or any self-documenting string a
   registering device desires to convey.































2.  Definition of Terms

   Address Family Identifier (AFI):  a term used to describe an address
      encoding in a packet.  An address family currently defined for
      IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.  See [AFI] and [RFC1700] for details on
      other types of information that can be AFI encoded.

3.  Distinguished Name Format

   An AFI=17 Distinguished Name is encoded as:

     0                   1                   2                   3
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |            AFI = 17           |       ASCII String ...        |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
    |               ...  ASCII String             |       0         |
    +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   The string of characters are encoded in the ASCII character-set
   definition [RFC0020].

   When Distinguished Names are encoded for EIDs, the EID-prefix length
   of the EIDs as they appear in EID-records for all LISP control
   messages is the length of the string in bits (include the null 0
   byte).  Where Distinguished Names are encoded anywhere else (i.e.
   nested in LCAF encodings), then any length field is the length of the
   ASCII string including the null 0 byte in units of bytes.

   When Map-Requests are sent for an EID encoded in Distinguished Name
   format, an exact match request is performed.  So the Map-Server (when
   configured for proxy-Map-Replying) or the ETR will return a Map-Reply
   with the same EID-prefix length.

4.  Example Use-Cases

   This section identifies three specific use-cases for the
   Distinguished Name format.  Two are used for an EID encoding and one
   for a RLOC-record encoding.  When storing public keys in the mapping
   system, as in [I-D.ietf-lisp-ecdsa-auth], a well known format for a
   public-key hash can be encoded as a Distinguished Name.  When street
   location to GPS coordinate mappings exist in the mapping system, as
   in [I-D.farinacci-lisp-geo], the street location can be a free form
   ascii representation (with whitespace characters) encoded as a
   Distinguished Name.  An RLOC that describes an xTR behind a NAT
   device can be identified by its router name, as in
   [I-D.farinacci-lisp-simple-nat], uses a Distinguished Name encoding.
   As well as identifying the router name (neither an EID or an RLOC) in
   NAT Info-Request messages uses Distinguished Name encodings.

5.  Name Collision Considerations

   When a Distinguished Name encoding is used to format an EID, the
   uniqueness and allocation concerns are no different than registering
   IPv4 or IPv6 EIDs to the mapping system.  See
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis] for more details.  Also, the use-case
   documents specified in Section 4 provide allocation recommendations
   for their specific uses.

6.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   The code-point values in this specification are already allocated in
   [AFI].
