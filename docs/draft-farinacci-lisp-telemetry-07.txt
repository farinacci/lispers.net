1.  Introduction

   This document describes how the Locator/Identifier Separation
   Protocol (LISP) can obtain, measure, and distribute data-plane
   telemetry information.  LISP is an encapsulation protocol built
   around the fundamental idea of separating the topological location of
   a network attachment point from the node's identity
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis].  As a result LISP creates two namespaces:
   Endpoint Identifiers (EIDs), that are used to identify end-hosts and
   routable Routing Locators (RLOCs), used to identify network
   attachment points.  LISP then defines functions for mapping between
   the two namespaces and for encapsulating traffic originated by
   devices using non-routable EIDs for transport across a network
   infrastructure that routes and forwards using RLOCs.

   This document specifies how a decapsulating xTR returns telemetry
   data to an encapsulating xTR using RLOC-probe messages defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6833bis].

   Early versions of this document will define the type and format of
   the telemetry data and how it will be distributed.  Later versions of
   this document will describe how telemetry measurement will be
   performed.

2.  Definition of Terms

   Encapsulating xTR  is a LISP ITR, RTR, or PITR data-plane network
      element [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis].  An encapsulating xTR
      typically sends RLOC-probe Map-Request messages to decapsulating
      xTRs to test for reachability of RLOC addresses.  For the design
      scope of this specification, RLOC-probes are also sent to obtain
      LISP telemetry data measured by a decapsulating xTR.

   Decapsulating xTR  is a LISP ETR, RTR, or PETR data-plane network
      element [I-D.ietf-lisp-rfc6830bis].  A decapsulating xTR typically
      RLOC-probe replies with a Map-Reply message to an RLOC-probe Map-
      Request sent by an encapsulating xTR.  When a decapsulating xTR
      does data-plane telemetry measurement, it returns measurement data
      in RLOC-probe Map-Reply messages to an encapsulating xTR.

   Telemetry Record  a telemetry record is an RLOC-record that contains
      telemetry data specified in this document.  The telemetry data is
      encoded as an LCAF JSON Type specified in [RFC8060].

3.  Overview

   The following list of telemetry data has been identified as being
   useful to obtain:

   o  Packet Count - the number of packets received within a given time
      window between the encapsulating xTR and decapsulating xTR.

   o  Byte Count - the number bytes summed from all packets received
      within a given time window between the encapsulating xTR and
      decapsulating xTR.

   o  Packet Rate - the rate in packets per second an encapsulating xTR
      is sending encapsulated packets to a decapsulating xTR.

   o  Bit Rate - the bit rate per second an encapsulating xTR is sending
      encapsulated packets to a decapsulating xTR.

   o  Bandwidth - the amount of bandwidth used between encapsulating xTR
      and decapsulating xTR in bytes per second.

   o  Packet Loss - the number of packets lost within a given time
      window between the encapsulating xTR and decapsulating xTR.

   o  Packet Jitter - the amount of inter-packet time for a train of
      packets within a given time window between the encapsulating xTR
      and decapsulating xTR.

   o  Forward Hop-Count - the number underlay router hops from the
      encapsulating xTR to the decapsulating xTR.

   o  Forward One-Way Latency - the amount of time from the
      encapsulating xTR to the decapsulating xTR.  Available when a
      universal clock and rough time synchronization is available.

   o  Reverse TTL - the TTL value a decapsulating xTR is using for the
      RLOC-probe Map-Reply.  This is used to compute the return or
      Reverse Hop-Count or number of underlay router hops between the
      decapsulating xTR and encapsulating xTR.

   o  Reverse Timestamp - the universal clock timestamp when the
      decapsulating xTR sent the RLOC-probe Map-Reply message.  This is
      used to compute the return or Reverse One-Way Latency between the
      decapsulating xTR to the encapsulating xTR.

4.  Telemetry Record Encoding

   A Telemetry Record is an RLOC-record encoded in LCAF JSON Type format
   [RFC8060] within the EID-record inserted in a RLOC-probe Map-Reply
   message.  The RLOC-record is appended to the existing RLOC-records
   for the EID being probed.

   An encapsulating xTR does not need to request telemetry data so the
   decapsulating xTR can provide it unilaterally by default or via
   configuration to enable the feature.  When an encapsulating xTR
   receives a Telemetry Record in a RLOC-probe Map-Reply, it SHOULD NOT
   store it in the map-cache and not use the RLOC-record for forwarding
   (since there are no RLOCs in this record).  The priority for this
   RLOC-record MUST be set to 255 and the weight MUST be set to 0.

   The JSON key values imply directionality.  The directionality is from
   encapsulating xTR to decapsulating xTR.  That is, the same direction
   of RLOC-probe Map-Requests and encapsulated packet flow.  The JSON
   string format is defined to be:

   { "type" :              "telemetry",
     "packet-count" :      "<pc>",
     "packet-loss" :       "<pl>",
     "byte-count" :        "<bc>",
     "packet-rate" :       "<pr>",
     "bit-rate" :          "<br>",
     "bandwidth" :         "<b>",
     "packet-jitter" :     "<pj>",
     "forward-latency" :   "<fl>",
     "forward-hop-count" : "<hc>",
     "reverse-ttl" :       "<ttl>",
     "reverse-timestamp" : "<ts>"
   }

5.  Security Considerations

   RLOC-probe Map-Reply messages are signed to protect and authenticate
   the Telemetry Record according to details in [I-D.ietf-lisp-sec].
   Telemetry Records can be kept confidential by encrypting RLOC-probe
   Map-Reply message with the asymmetric keys described in
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-ecdsa-auth] or the symmetric keys computed by the key
   exchange detailed in [RFC8061].
