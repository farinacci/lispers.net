1.  Introduction

   This draft documents the LISP messages and protocol procedures for a
   simple mechanism for the NAT Traversal problem.  A subset of message
   definitions and protocol procedures are taken from
   [I-D.ermagan-lisp-nat-traversal].  This design was first implemented
   in the lispers.net LISP implementation dating back to January 2014.

   The procedures described in this document are performed by LISP
   compliant [RFC9300] [RFC9301] xTRs that reside on the private side of
   one or more NAT devices that connect them to the public side of the
   network.

   The solution is applicable to the following xTR deployments:

   *  A physical ITR/ETR device that is directly connected or multiple
      hops away from a NAT device.

   *  A LISP-MN acting as an ITR/ETR device on an cellular service where
      a mobile provider is providing a NAT function.

   *  A logical ITR/ETR that resides in a VM that is behind a NAT device
      managed by a hypervisor or cloud provider.

   *  A logical ITR/ETR that resides in a container where a NAT function
      is provided by the container service.

   *  The above xTR deployments can operate through multiple levels of
      NATs.

   *  The above deployments are also applicable to RTR and PxTR devices
      that may reside behind NAT devices.

   *  The lispers.net lig [RFC6835] implementation uses the protocol
      messaging defined in this draft so any system behind a NAT (either
      running as a LISP xTR or not running LISP at all), can query the
      mapping system to obtain mappings for network maintenance and
      troubleshooting.

2.  Definition of Terms

   Routing Locator (RLOC):  an RLOC address is a routable address on the
      public Internet.  It is used by LISP to locate where EIDs are
      topologically located and appears in the outer header of LISP
      encapsulated packets.  With respect to this design, an RLOC can be
      a private or public address.  Private RLOCs can be registered to
      the LISP mapping system so they can be used by other LISP xTRs
      which reside in the same private network.  Public RLOCs can be
      registered to the LISP mapping system and are used by LISP xTRs
      that are on the public side of the network.

   Network Address Translator (NAT):  is a router type device that
      isolates a private network from a public network.  The addresses
      used on the private side of a network are known as private
      addresses and are not routable on the public side of the network.
      Therefore, a NAT device must translate private addresses to public
      addresses.  In this document, xTRs that reside on the private side
      of the network use private RLOCs.  These RLOCs must be translated
      to public addresses so they can be registered in the LISP mapping
      system.

   Private RLOC:  is the IP address of the interface of an xTR that
      faces outbound towards a NAT device.  This address is typically
      translated to a public RLOC address before the packet appears on
      the public side of the network.

   Ephemeral Port:  is the UDP source port in a LISP data-plane or

      control-plane message.  This address is typically translated by a
      NAT device when the packet goes from the private side of the NAT
      device to the public side of the network.

   Global RLOC:  is an address that has been translated by a NAT device.
      The Private RLOC is translated to a Global RLOC and is registered
      to the mapping system.  This RLOC will be the source address in
      LISP encapsulated packets on the public side of the network.

   Translated Port:  is the Ephemeral Port that is translated by a NAT
      device.  For an xTR outgoing packet, the source Ephemeral Port is
      translated to a source Translated Port seen by the public side of
      the network.  For an incoming packet, the NAT device translates
      the destination Translated Port to the destination Ephemeral Port.

   Re-encapsulating Tunnel Router (RTR):  is a LISP network element that
      receives a LISP encapsulated packet, strips the outer header and
      prepends a new outer header.  With respect to this NAT-Traversal
      design, an ITR (either behind a NAT device or on the public
      network) encapsulates a packet to the RTR's RLOC address.  The RTR
      strips this ITR prepended header and then prepends a its own new
      outer header and sends packet to the RLOC address of an ETR that
      registered the EID that appears as the destination address from
      the inner header.

   NAT Info Cache:  is a data structure managed by an RTR to track xTR
      hostname, Global RLOC and Translated Port information.  The RTR
      uses this table so it knows what is the destination port to be
      used for LISP encapsulated packets that much travel through a NAT
      device.

   Address Family Identifier (AFI):  a term used to describe an address
      encoding in a packet [AFI] and [RFC1700].  All LISP control
      messages use AFI encoded addresses.  The AFI value is 16-bits in
      length and precedes all LISP encoded addresses.  In this document,
      the design calls for AFI encodings for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as
      well as Distinguished-Name [I-D.ietf-lisp-name-encoding] and LCAF
      [RFC8060] address formats.

3.  Overview

   The following sequence of actions describes at a high-level how the
   lispers.net implementation performs NAT-Traversal and is the basis
   for a simplified NAT-Traversal protocol design.

   1.   An xTR sends a Info-Request message to port 4342 to its
        configured Map-Servers so it can get a list of RTRs to be used
        for NAT-Traversal.

Internet-Draft           lispers.net Simple NAT             January 2023


   2.   The Map-Servers return an Info-Reply message with the list of
        RTRs.

   3.   The xTR then sends an Info-Request message to port 4341 to each
        RTR.

   4.   Each RTR caches the translated RLOC address and port in a NAT
        Info Cache.  At this point, the NAT device has created state to
        allow the RTR to send encapsulated packets from port 4341 to the
        translated port.

   5.   The RTR returns an Info-Reply message so the xTR can learn its
        translated Global RLOC address and Translated Port.

   6.   The xTR registers its EID-prefixes with an RLOC-set that
        contains all its global RLOCs as well as the list of RTRs it has
        learned from Info-Reply messages.

   7.   The Map-Servers are configured to proxy Map-Reply for these
        registered EID-prefixes.

   8.   When a remote ITR sends a Map-Request for an EID that matches
        one of these EID-prefixes, the Map-Server returns a partial
        RLOC-set which contain only the list of RTRs.  The remote ITR
        encapsulates packets to the RTRs.

   9.   When one of the RTRs send a Map-Request for an EID that matches
        one of these EID-prefixes, the Map-Server returns a partial
        RLOC-set which contain only the global RLOCs so the RTR can
        encapsulate packets that will make it through the NAT device to
        the xTR.

   10.  The xTR behind a NAT device only stores default map-cache
        entries with an RLOC-set that contain the list of RTRs the Map-
        Server supplied it with.  The xTR load-splits traffic across the
        RTRs based on the 5-tuple hash algorithm detailed in [RFC9300].

4.  Protocol Messages

   The lispers.net implementation uses the Info-Request and Info-Reply
   messages from [I-D.ermagan-lisp-nat-traversal] as well as the NAT-
   Traversal LISP Canonical Address Format (LCAF) from [RFC8060].

   LISP Info-Request Message Format

   The lispers.net implementation will send an Info-Request message to
   each configured Map-Server.  The message is sent to UDP destination
   port 4342 which is the control-plane port for LISP [RFC9301] from a
   UDP ephemeral source port.  The source address is its Private RLOC.
   When the xTR is multi-homed to more than one NAT device, it sends the
   Info-Request on all interfaces facing NAT devices.

   A randomized 64-bit nonce is selected for the message and no
   authentication is used.  The EID-prefix AFI is 17 according to the
   encoding format in [I-D.ietf-lisp-name-encoding] and the EID-prefix
   is the hostname of the xTR encoded as a string null terminated.

   An Info-Request is sent out each outgoing interface, with the address
   of that interface as the Private RLOC, leading to a NAT device.  The
   port pair in the UDP message is the same for each outgoing interface.

   When the xTR receives an Info-Reply message from the Map-Server in
   response to this control-plane Info-Request, it caches a list of RTRs
   from the Info-Reply.  If the list of RTRs are different from each
   Map-Server, the lists are merged.  The xTR stores the merged list as
   the RLOC-set for 4 default map-cache entries.  The map-cache entries
   have the following EID-prefixes:

           IPv4 multicast:    (0.0.0.0/0, 224.0.0.0/4)
           IPv6 unicast:       0::/0
           IPv6 multicast:    (0::/0, ff00::/8)


   Now that the xTR has a list of RTRs, it sends a data-plane Info-
   Request to each RTR to UDP destination port 4341 from a UDP ephemeral
   source port.  The data-plane Info-Request is sent out each interface
   just like the control-plane Info-Request was sent for the multi-homed
   NAT device case.

   When Map-Servers and RTRs return an Info-Reply message to xTRs behind
   NAT devices, the format of the Info-Reply message is the following:

   LISP Info-Reply Message Format

   The information returned is the same information that was sent in the
   Info-Request message except the Info-Reply bit is set (the bit next
   to Type=7) and the NAT Traversal LCAF encoding is appended.

   When a Map-Server returns the Info-Reply, the MS UDP Port Number and
   ETR UDP Port Number is set to 0.  All Address fields are empty by
   using AFI equal to 0.  Except for the RTR RLOC address fields which
   the Map-Server is configured to return to xTRs behind NAT devices.

   When an RTR returns the Info-Reply, the MS UDP Port Number is set to
   0 and the ETR UDP Port Number is set to the UDP source port the RTR
   received from the Info-Request message.  The Global ETR RLOC Address
   is set to the source address received by the RTR in the Info-Request
   message.  All other address fields are empty by using AFI equal to 0.

5.  xTR Map-Registering and Map-Server Proxy Map-Replying

   EID-prefixes registered by an xTR behind a NAT include all the global
   RLOCs and RTR RLOCs it learns.  The xTR can use the unicast priority
   to control ingress packet flow as described in [RFC9301].  The RTR
   RLOCs must be registered with a unicast priority of 254 so the Map-
   Server can identify xTR global RLOCs from RTR RLOCs when proxy Map-
   Replying.

   The Global RLOCs are encoded in a RLOC-record using the AFI-List LCAF
   encoding [RFC8060].  There are two AFI encoded addresses in the list,
   one being AFI=1 which encodes the IPv4 translated NAT address and
   other being the Distinguished-Name AFI=17
   [I-D.ietf-lisp-name-encoding] which encodes the hostname of the xTR.
   When the xTR is multi-homed, the hostname is appended by a unique
   interface name.  For example, for an xTR behind a NAT that has two
   interfaces facing the same or two different NAT devices, the
   Distinguished-Name for each RLOC-record could be "dino-xtr-eth0" and
   "dino-xtr-eth1" for an xTR configured to be named "dino-xtr".

   Encoding a Distinguished-Name in an RLOC-record is important so an
   RTR can use the Global RLOC registered to the mapping system with the
   translated port stored in its NAT Info Cache.  See Section 8 for more
   details.

   When a remote ITR sends a Map-Request for a unicast or multicast EID
   registered by a xTR behind a NAT, the Map-Server returns a partial
   RLOC-set that contains all the RTRs (RLOC-records with unicast
   priority 254) in the proxied Map-Reply message.

6.  Packet Flow from ITR-behind-NAT to RTR

   All packets received by the ITR from the private side of the NAT will
   use one of the 4 default map-cache entries.  There is a unicast and
   multicast IPv4 default EID-prefix and a unicast and multicast IPv6
   default EID-prefix.  The RLOC-set is the same for all 4 entries.  The
   RLOC-set contains the globally reachable RLOCs of the RTRs. 5-tuple
   hashing is used to load-split traffic across the RTRs.  RLOC-Probing
   is used to avoid encapsulating to unreachable RTRs.

7.  Packet Flow from Remote ITR to RTR

   A remote ITR will get a list of RTRs from the mapping system in a
   proxy Map-Reply when it sends a Map-Request for a unicast or
   multicast EID that is registered by an xTR behind a NAT device.  The
   remote ITR will load split traffic across the RTRs from the RLOC-set.
   Those RTRs can get packets through the NAT devices destined for the
   xTR behind the NAT since an Info-Request/Info-Reply exchange had
   already happened between the xTR behind the NAT and the list of RTRs.

   There can be a reachability situation where an RTR cannot reach the
   xTR behind a NAT but a remote ITR may 5-tuple hash to this RTR.
   Which means packets can travel from the remote ITR to the RTR but
   then get dropped on the path from the RTR to the xTR behind the NAT.
   To avoid this situation, the xTR behind the NAT RLOC-probes RTRs and
   when they become unreachable, they are not included in the xTR
   registrations.

8.  Packet Flow from RTR to ETR-behind-NAT

   The RTR will receive a list of Global RLOCs in a proxy Map-Reply from
   the mapping system for the xTR behind the NAT.  The RTR 5-tuple load-
   splits packets across the RLOC-set of Global RLOCs that can travel
   through one or more NAT devices along the path to the ETR behind the
   NAT device.

   When the RTR selects a Global RLOC to encapsulate to it must select
   the correct Translated Port for the UDP destination port in the
   encapsulation header.  The RTR needs to use the same Translated
   Address and Translated Port pair a NAT device used to translate the
   Info-Request message otherwise the encapsulated packet will be
   dropped.  The NAT Info Cache contains an entry for every hostname
   (and optionally appended interface name), translated address and port
   cached when processing Info-Request messages.  The RTR obtains the
   correct Translated Port from the NAT Info Cache by using the Global
   RLOC and RLOC-record hostname from the registered RLOC-set.

   The RTR can test reachability for xTRs behind NATs by encapsulating
   RLOC-Probe requests in data packets where the UDP source port is set
   to 4341 and the UDP destination port is set to the Translated Port.
   The outer header destination address is the Global RLOC for the xTR.

9.  Decentralized NAT

   A decentralized version of this design is also supported in the
   lispers.net implementation.  See [DECENT-NAT] for an overview.  The
   design allows direct encapsulation from an ITR to an ETR when they
   both reside behind NAT devices.  Packets do not have to take a sub-
   optimal path through the RTR.  The RTR does play a role in informing
   the ETRs about their translated address and port number just as it
   does for the centralized version.  Here are some details of the
   design:

   *  Like the centralized version, each ETR registers its global RLOC
      address by sending a Map-Register message using an RLOC-Record
      name of its hostname.  In addition, for Decentralized-NAT, the
      translated port number is part of the RLOC-Record name, for
      example "dino-macbook@tp-34265".

   *  When an ITR sends a Map-Request, it sets the Decent-NAT bit so the
      Map-Server returns the entire RLOC-set so the ITR can encapsulate
      directly to the ETR or through the RTR for cases the ETR goes path
      unreachable.  The Map-Request N-bit below is used for Decent-NAT:

       0                   1                   2                   3
       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
      |Type=1 |A|M|P|S|p|s|m|I|  Rsvd |N|L|D|   IRC   | Record Count  |
      +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

   *  When the ITR receives a proxy Map-Reply from the Map-Server, it
      stores the entire RLOC-set in a map-cache entry.  From the RLOC-
      record, the global translated address and the translated port
      number from the RLOC-record name is stored and used for
      encapsulation.

   *  The ITR will next send a NAT probe Info-Request to the global
      translated RLOC and translated port for the remote xTR using UDP
      source port 4341 opening up the NAT to allow packets to be
      received through the local NAT.

   *  The ITR encapsulates packets with a private source address and UDP
      source port 4341 to a global destination address with a UDP
      destination translated port.

Internet-Draft           lispers.net Simple NAT             January 2023


   *  At this point if the ITR encapsulates packets to the ETR that it
      cannot receive.  The ETR will not receive packets because it has
      not opened up its NAT.  It can only do this when it decides to
      encapsulate packets back.  If bidirectional traffic begins by an
      initiating application client which causes a response packet from
      the application server, the response packet can not be sent
      because the remote side has not opened up its NAT to receive the
      client packet.  To solve this circular dependency problem, the ITR
      will send a few packets to the RTR that can get through the NAT to
      the ETR.  Then response packets can now be returned using the same
      process as described above.

   *  At this point, when both xTRs have map-cache entries and have sent
      NAT Info-Request probes, packets can flow in both directions
      directly from local ITR to remote ETR and from remote-ITR to
      local-ETR.  This increases packet delivery performance since there
      is no packet hair-pinning.

   *  Both sides can RLOC-probe directly to obtain reachability status
      and underlay telemetry statistics.

   Your feature mileage may vary depending on the type of NAT or
   firewall deployed.  There is an assumption that the translated port
   for an xTR that sends to the RTR is the same translated port used for
   other destinations.

10.  Design Observations

   The following benefits and observations can be attributed to this
   design:

   *  An ITR behind a NAT virtually runs no control-plane and a very
      simple data-plane.  All it does is RLOC-probe the RTRs in the
      common RLOC-set for each default map-cache entry.  And maintains a
      very small map-cache of 4 entries per instance-ID it supports.

   *  An xTR behind a NAT can tell if another xTR is behind the same set
      of NAT devices and use Private RLOCs to reach each other on a
      short-cut path.  It does this by comparing the Global RLOC
      returned from RTRs in Info-Reply messages.

   *  An xTR behind a NAT is free to send a Map-Request to the mapping
      system for any EID to test to see if there is a direct path to the
      LISP site versus potentially using a sub-optimal path through an
      RTR.  This happens when xTRs exist that are not behind NAT devices
      where their RLOCs are global RLOCs.

Internet-Draft           lispers.net Simple NAT             January 2023


   *  By sending Info-Requests to Map-Servers, an xTR behind a NAT can
      tell if they are reachable and if those Map-Servers also act as
      Map-Resolvers, the xTR behind the NAT can avoid sending Map-
      Requests to unreachable Map-Resolvers.

   *  Enhanced data-plane security can be used via LISP-Crypto
      mechanisms detailed in [RFC8061] using this NAT-Traversal design
      so both unicast and multicast traffic are encrypted.

   *  This design allows for the minimum amount of NAT device state
      since only RTRs are encapsulating to ETRs behind NAT devices.
      Therefore, the number of ITRs sending packets to EIDs behind NAT
      devices is aggregated out for scale.  Scale is also achieved when
      xTRs behind NATs roam and RLOC-set changes need to update only RTR
      map-caches.

   *  The protocol procedures in this document can be used when a LISP
      site has multiple xTRs each connected via separate NAT devices to
      the public network.  Each xTR registers their Global RLOCs and
      RTRs with merge semantics to the mapping system so remote ITRs can
      load-split traffic across a merged RTR set as well as RTRs across
      each xTR behind different NAT devices.

11.  Security Considerations

   There are no security considerations at this time.

   However, the lispers.net implementation can be enhanced easily to
   allow the same authentication xTRs use with Map-Register messages for
   Info-Request messages when they send to Map-Servers.

   For authentication of Info-Requests to RTRs, more work is required to
   maintain key management associations between xTR behind NATs and
   RTRs.  It is not trivial to make this happen with a dynamic list of
   RTRs that can change as the xTR behind a NAT roams to other parts of
   the network and desire shorter paths to RTRs.

12.  IANA Considerations

   The code-point values in this specification are already allocated in
   [AFI] or [RFC8060].
