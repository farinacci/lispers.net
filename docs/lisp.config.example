                    lispers.net LISP Command Guide
                    ------------------------------
              Last updated: Mon Oct  8 15:08:27 PDT 2018

This document contains the command syntax defintions that go into configuration
file lisp.config. You can copy, paste, and edit the clauses below into your
customized lisp.config file.

See details in the header of the lisp.config file on how to interact with
the LISP subsystem configuration system.

Note where you see "..." below means the clause or sub-clause can be repeated.
And where you see angle brackets, user provided data must be supplied.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                            Shell Commands
                            --------------

Run from the lispers.net directory:

RUN-LISP
    This command starts the lispers.net LISP subsystem when it has not been
    previously started and is called from RESTART-LISP.
    
STOP-LISP
    This command stops the LISP subsystem and is called from RESTART-LISP.

RESTART-LISP
    This command will stop and run the lispers.net LISP subsystem. It first
    calls script STOP-LISP then script RUN-LISP.
    
RL
    This command is a wrapper script to RESTART-LISP. It is used to tailor
    where the lispers.net directory is installed and how to configure the
    kernel for any EID addresses local to the system. The user creates their
    own copy and can find a template in RL-template.
    
pslisp
    Displays each running lispers.net LISP process running as part of the
    LISP subsystem.

log-packets [force]
    Toggles "itr = yes|no", "etr = yes|no", "rtr = yes|no" from the "lisp
    debug" command clause as well as toggle "data-plane-logging = yes|no"
    from the "lisp xtr-parameters" command clause. Use "force" keyword to do
    the  toggle if control-plane logging was previously turned on (meaning
    "data-plane-logging" was set to "no").

more show-xtr
    When the GO data-plane is running, the show-xtr file displays state that
    is required to run the LISP data-plane. This file can be displayed from the
    web interface by clicking on either the "LISP ITR Map-Cache" or "LISP RTR
    Map-Cache" title. The GO data-plane is a faster less feature-rich LISP
    data-plane compared to the Python data-plane. To enable the GO data-plane
    uncomment the LISP_RUN_XTR env variable line in the RUN-LISP script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                   Enabling LISP Network Components
                  ---------------------------------

Command syntax:

lisp enable {
    itr = yes | no
    etr = yes | no
    rtr = yes | no
    map-server = yes | no
    map-resolver = yes | no
    ddt-node = yes | no
}

Command Description:
    The "lisp enable" command will run the different components of the LISP
    protocol. When they are not included in the command clause, it is the same
    as configuring it to "no".

Example:

lisp enable {
    map-server = yes
    map-resolver = yes
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                        Enabling Debug Logging
                        ----------------------

Command syntax:

lisp debug {
    itr = yes | no
    etr = yes | no
    rtr = yes | no
    map-server = yes | no
    map-resolver = yes | no
    ddt-node = yes | no
}

Command Description:
    The "lisp debug" enables very detail debugging for each component of the
    LISP subsystem.

Example:

lisp debug {
    itr = no
    etr = no
    rtr = no
    map-server = yes
    map-resolver = yes
    ddt-node = yes
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

              Configuring Account for Web and API Access
              ------------------------------------------

Command syntax:

lisp user-account {
    username = <user>
    password = <user-password>
    super-user = yes | no
}
...

Command Description:
   Configures a username/password combination that allows the user to use
   the LISP subsystem web interface. A null password is allowed (see example
   below). When super-user is set to "yes", you can add user accounts from
   the lispers.net API management interface.

Example:

lisp user-account {
    username = root
    password = super-user-password
    super-user = yes
}
lisp user-account {
    username = admin
    password = 
    super-user = no
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Configuring LISP Specific Policies
                  ----------------------------------

Command syntax:

lisp policy {
    policy-name = <policy-name>
    match {
        instance-id = <iid>
        source-eid = <prefix>
        destination-eid = <prefix> | <source-prefix>-><group-prefix>
        source-rloc = <prefix>
        destination-rloc = <prefix>
        rloc-record-name = <name>
        geo-name = <geo-name>
        elp-name = <elp-name>
        rle-name = <rle-name>
        json-name = <json-name>
        datetime-range = <yyyy-mm-dd-hh:mm:ss> <yyyy-mm-dd-hh:mm:ss>
    }
    ...
    set-action = process | drop
    set-record-ttl = <ttl>
    set-instance-id = <iid>
    set-source-eid = <prefix>
    set-destination-eid = <prefix> | <source-prefix>-><group-prefix>
    set-rloc-address = <address>
    set-rloc-record-name = <name>
    set-geo-name = <geo-name>
    set-elp-name = <elp-name>
    set-rle-name = <rle-name>
    set-json-name = <json-name>
}

Description:
    Match all the parameters configured in any 'match' subclause and the 
    actions configured in the 'set' subclause will be taken with the values
    configured in the subclause.

Example:

lisp policy {
    policy-name = filter-private-addresses
    match {
        source-eid = 192.168.0.0/16
    }
    match {
        source-eid = 10.0.0.0/8
    }
    set-action = drop
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

              Configuring Interface Specific Parameters
              -----------------------------------------


Command syntax:

lisp interface {
    interface-name = <interface-name>
    device = <device-name>
    instance-id = <iid>
    dynamic-eid = <prefix>
    dynamic-eid-device = <route-device-name>
    dynamic-eid-timeout = <timeout-in-seconds>
    multi-tenant-eid = <prefix>
    lisp-nat = yes | no
}

Description:
    Configures interface specific LISP parameters for unix device with name
    <interface-name>.

    When "instance-id = <iid>" is specified, any packets that arrive or are
    delivered on the interface will be associated with instance-ID <iid>. On
    an ITR, any packets arriving on the interface will cause the source to
    be associated with instance-id <iid> and the destination address will
    be an EID lookup associated with instance-id <iid>. On an ETR, during
    decapsulation, the packet is forwarded using the kernel routing table
    associated with the configured <iid>.

    When "dynamic-eid = <prefix>" is specified, only sources that match the
    <prefix> will be accepted as dynamically discovered EIDs. For specifying
    which EID-prefixes are dynamic versus static, use the "dynamic-eid = yes" 
    sub-clause in the "lisp database-mapping" command. When a dynamic-EID is
    discovered then a route for it will be added to the kernel routing tables
    with a next-hop interface <device-name>, unless "dynamic-eid-device" is 
    configured in which case the next-hop interface for the route is 
    <route-device-name>.

    When "dynamic-eid = 0000-0000-0000/0" is used and "dynamic-eid = yes"
    is configured in the "lisp database-mapping" command clause for 
    "eid-prefix = 0000-0000-0000/0", the xTR will act as a L2-overlay node
    and dynamically discover and register MAC addresses (as EIDs).

    The default inactivity timer is 15 seconds. Unless "dynamic-eid-timeout"
    is configured. The units are in seconds.

    When "multi-tenant-eid" is configured, there can be multiple tenants
    on a single xTR interface. Based on the EID-prefix configured, an
    instance-ID can be assigned to each tenant. See last example below 
    where one tenant has EIDs out of 10.0.0.0/8 and is on interface eth0
    and the other tenant, also on interface eth0, has EIDs out of 11.0.0.0/8.
    The first is assigned and registered to the mapping system with instance-ID
    10 and the other with instance-ID 11, respectively.

    When "lisp-nat = yes" is configured, a LISP xTR will do the LISP-NAT
    functionality of RFC6832 "Interworking between Locator/ID Separation 
    Protocol (LISP) and Non-LISP Sites". That means any packets that have
    EIDs embedded will be replaced with a routable address. This is an
    alternative to "route injected PxTRs" but has simpler properties where no 
    additional route injection is advertised into the core underlay. For xTRs 
    to attract such packets (acting as a PETR) from LISP sites, they must 
    register an EID-prefix that makes up the address space of non-LISP sites. 

Example:

#
# Assigning instance-ID of 1 to each EID on interface eth0.
#
lisp interface {
    interface-name = customer-1
    device = eth0
    instance-id = 1
}

#
# EIDs on interface eth1 get instance-ID 2 assigned and are discovered
# dynamically and registered when in range 10.0.0.0/8. When no packets
# are received from the dynamic-EIDS for 60 seconds are timed out and
# deregistered from the mapping system.
#
lisp interface {
    interface-name = customer-2
    device = eth1
    instance-id = 2
    dynamic-eid = 10.0.0.0/8
    dynamic-eid-timeout = 60
}

#
# EIDs on interface eth1 are associated with interface vlan1. Only EID
# 1.1.1.1 is discovered dynamcially and registered to the mapping system.
#
lisp interface {
    interface-name = customer-3
    device = eth1
    dynamic-eid = 1.1.1.1/32
    dynamic-eid-device = vlan1
    dynamic-eid-timeout = 1
}

#
# Assign instance-ID 10 and 11 to different tenants on the same interface 
# eth0 based on the source EID.
#
lisp interface {
    interface-name = tenant-1
    device = eth0
    instance-id = 10
    multi-tenant-eid = 10.0.0.0/8
}
lisp interface {
    interface-name = tenant-2
    device = eth0
    instance-id = 11
    multi-tenant-eid = 11.0.0.0/8
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

               Configuring ITR, ETR, or RTR Parameters
               ---------------------------------------

Command syntax:

lisp xtr-parameters {
    rloc-probing = yes | no
    nonce-echoing = yes | no
    data-plane-security = yes | no
    data-plane-logging = yes | no
    frame-logging = yes | no
    flow-logging = yes | no
    nat-traversal = yes | no
    checkpoint-map-cache = yes | no
    ipc-data-plane = yes | no
    register-reachable-rtrs = yes | no
    decentralized-push-xtr = yes | no
    decentralized-pull-xtr-modulus = <modulus-1-255>
    decentralized-pull-xtr-dns-suffix = <dns-name-suffix>
}

Command Description:
    Configures specific parameters for ITR, RTR, and ETR LISP components. 
    Here is a description of each parameter:

    rloc-probing
        Turns on sending of RLOC-Probe Map-Requests in ITRs and RTRs. When
        RLOC-probing is enabled and there are no RLOC-Probe Map-Replies 
        returned, the RLOC is put in "unreach-state" and is not used for
        encapsulating packets. The default setting is "no".

    nonce-echoing
        Turns on data nonce-echoing requests in an ITR/RTR and echoing of data 
        nonces in an ETR/RTR. An ETR/RTR will set the E-bit in a Map-Reply 
        indicating it is Nonce-Echo capable so an ITR/RTR will periodically 
        set the N and E bits in encapsulated packets requesting an ETR/RTR
        to echo the nonce. This allows the ITR/RTR to verify it has 
        reachability to the RLOC of the ETR/RTR via the underlay network.

    data-plane-secuirty
        Turns on encrpytion for any encapsulated packets the ITR or RTR sends.
        The ETR will decrypt by default as long as the security parameters
        are set in Map-Requests and in the LISP encapsulation header. The
        default setting is "no".

    data-plane-logging
        Turns on logging of data packets, all of received for forwarding,
        encapsulation, and decapsulation on xTRs and RTRs. The default 
        setting is "no". When set to "yes", data-plane logging is only 
        enabled when turned on via the "lisp debug" command clause or
        the "manage logging" button on the landing web page.

    frame-logging
        Turns on logging of MAC frame-level data packets. The default 
        setting is "no". When set to "yes", data-plane logging is only 
        enabled when turned on via the "lisp debug" command clause or
        the "manage logging" button on the landing web page.

    flow-logging
        Turns on logging of encapsulated flows in an ITR, ETR, and RTR.
        The default setting is "no". This can only be set by changing the
        lisp.config configuration file.

    nat-traversal
        Turns on xTR nat-traversal support. That means before an ETR sends
        Map-Register messages to its configured Map-Servers, it will send
        an Info-Request message so it can obtain the translated port and
        global/public address of itself. When an ITR/ETR reside behind a NAT
        device, it is assigned an private IP RLOC address. This address cannot
        be registered to the mapping system so a global/public address needs
        to be obtained. That is what "nat-traversal = yes" achieves. If there
        is no NAT on path, the ETR will register its local RLOCs (which are
        public addresses) but keep sending Info-Request messages to anticipate
        a NAT being placed in between the xTR and the Internet at a later time.
        When private addresses are in "rloc" clauses for the "lisp database-
        mapping" commands, they can be used by other xTRs behind the same
        NATs for local encapsulation (packets do not hair-pin through the RTR).

    checkpoint-map-cache
        Write map-cache entries to a checkpoint file periodically. And when
        the ITR/RTR restarts, it populates its map-cache with the entries from
        the checkpoint file. This parameter defaults to "no".

    ipc-data-plane
        When this is set to "yes", the lispers.net control-plane will program
        a external data-plane that may use any packet encapsulation it sees
        fit. This allows the lispers.net control-plane to be used with faster
        software forwarding or hardware forwarding implementations. When this
        feature is used, the lispers.net data-plane does not execute.

    register-reachable-rtrs
        When this is set to "yes" and NAT-traversal is in use, an xTR will
        register reachabile RTRs. Only reachable RTRs determine by RLOC-probing
        will be registered to the mapping system. The default setting is "no",
        which means all RTRs learned via Info-Reply messages from Map-Servers
        will be registered to the mapping system regardless of their
        reachability status.

    decentralized-push-xtr
        When this is set to "yes", an xTR will run a pushed-based Decentrailzed
        Mapping System (DMS). That is an xTR is configured as an ITR, ETR, Map-
        Resolver and Map-Server. The "lisp map-server" command must supply a
        group address for the peer-group. Details of the design can be found
        in the Internet Draft draft-farinacci-lisp-decent. All xTRs will have a
        synchronized mapping system realized by draft-ietf-lisp-signal-free-
        multicast. There is no dependence on a third-party mapping system. The
        xTRs contribute to maintaining a mapping system for their own use. For 
        initial testing, you must create a file "join-<group-address>" in the 
        lispers.net directory. The <group-address> must match the group
        address in the "lisp map-server" command and the "lisp group-mapping"
        command. There is a template file called lisp.config.decent-xtr
        available for use. The default setting for this sub-command is "no".

    decentralized-pull-xtr-modulus
    decentralized-pull-xtr-dns-suffix
        When specified, implements the use of the pull-based LISP-Decentralized
        Mapping System. The LISP-Decent pull-based mapping system is a cluster
        of map-servers being configured as the entire mapping system. The
        cluster is made up of many map-server sets that are indexed based on a
        hash of the EID being lookup up in a Map-Request or being registered
        in a Map-Register. The index is part of a DNS name used to identify
        the set  The index is calculated by using the hash of the EID modulo
        the "<modulus-1-255>" value and prepended to DNS name "<dns-name-
        suffix>". So if an EID [200]1.1.1.1 is hashed modulo <modulus-1-255>
        is 3 then the DNS name "3.<dns-name-suffix>" will be used for a DNS
        lookup to obtain the addresses of the map-resolver/map-server set. For
        Map-Requests, an ITR round-robin requests to each Map-Resolver in the
        set. For Map-Registers, the ETR sends to each address in the set. The
        "lisp map-server" commands are required with "dns-name" for each
        map-server set DNS name constructed.

Example:

lisp xtr-parameters {
    rloc-probing = yes
    nonce-echoing = yes
    data-plane-security = yes
    data-plane-logging = no
    nat-traversal = no
}

#
# Configure to use 2 map-server sets in an xTR with DNS suffix name of
# map-server.lispers.net.
#
lisp xtr-parameters {
    decentralized-pull-xtr-modulus = 2
    decentralized-pull-xtr-dns-suffix = map-server.lispers.net
}
lisp map-resolver {
    dns-name = 0.map-server.lispers.net
}
lisp map-server {
    dns-name = 0.map-server.lispers.net
    authentication-key = <key1>
}
lisp map-resolver {
    dns-name = 1.map-server.lispers.net
}
lisp map-server {
    dns-name = 1.map-server.lispers.net
    authentication-key = <key2>
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Configure the Map-Resolver address on an ITR and RTR
         ----------------------------------------------------

Command syntax:

lisp map-resolver {
    mr-name = <map-resolver-name>
    address = x.x.x.x | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz
    dns-name = <dns-name>
    ...
}
...

Command Description:
    Configures one or more Map-Resolver addresses in an ITR or RTR. Each 
    command clause configures an additional Map-Resolver.

Example:

lisp map-resolver {
    mr-name = my-nearest-map-resolver
    address = 1.1.1.1
}
lisp map-resolver {
    address = 2001:1:1:1::1
    address = 2.2.2.2
}
lisp map-resolver {
    dns-name = mr1.lispers.net
    dns-name = mr2.lispers.net
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                  Configure a Static Map-Cache Entry
                  ----------------------------------

Command syntax:

lisp map-cache {
    prefix {
        instance-id = <0 - 4294967295>
        eid-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
        group-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
        send-map-request = yes | no
    }
    rloc {
        address = x.x.x.x | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
        rloc-record-name = <name>
        elp-name = <elp-name>
        rle-name = <rle-name>
        priority = <0 - 255>
        weight = <0 - 100>
    }
    ...
}
...

Command Description:
    Configures a static map-cache entry in an ITR or RTR. Each command clause
    configures an additional map-cache entry. Typically, map-cache entries are
    learned dynamically and on-demand via the Mapping Database System so this
    command is only required in special circumstances.

    When "send-map-request" is set to "yes", an "rloc" clause is not required.
    The entry will cause any destination EID that matches the eid-prefix to
    send a Map-Request to the mapping system.

Example:

lisp map-cache {
    prefix {
        eid-prefix = 8.0.0.0/8
    }
    rloc {
        address = 1.1.1.1
        priority = 1
        weight = 50
    }
    rloc {

}
...

Command Description:
    Configures a database-mapping entry in the ETR. These are the entries the
    ETR registers to the Mapping Database System. All ETRs that reside at a
    LISP site must configure all RLOCs (all ETRs). "<elp-name>" references
    a configured "lisp explicit-locator-path" command. "<geo-name>" references
    a configured "lisp geo-coordinates" command. "<json-name>" references
    a configured "lisp json" command.

    The format for an EID-prefix is self documenting. That is, a value with
    a dot is an IPv4 address, a colon an IPv6 address, dashes is a MAC
    address, a leading plus sign is a E.164 number, single quotes is a
    distinguished name, and dashes with N, S, W, E is a geo-prefix. See
    the "lisp geo-coordinates" command description for the format details
    for geo-prefixes. E.164 address prefixes must start with a "+" sign,
    may be <= 16 digits with values 0-9, and end with /64.

    The "instance-id" parameter scopes the eid-prefix within a VPN context for
    closed user group connectivity. If the "instance-id" is configured with
    an IID list "<iid1> <iid2> ... <iidn>" then the eid-prefix belongs to more
    than one VPN and is "extra-netting". Extra-netting is allowing EIDs in one
    VPN to talk to EIDs in other VPNs. Typically, an EID in a VPN will also 
    want to talk to services in the default Internet (EIDs registered in 
    instance-ID 0), so one would configure "instance-id = <vpn-iid> 0". 

    To interwork with a PETR or a LISP-NAT gateway, they may be registered in 
    another VPN. To allow LISP-site to LISP-site to talk to each other as well
    as have a LISP-site in a VPN talk to the interworking gateways, a lookup 
    in the <vpn-iid> map-cache must be performed first and if not found or a 
    negative Map-Reply is returned, then a loolup is performed in the next iid
    in the IID list "<iid1> <iid2> ... <iidn>" (in the example above it would 
    be iid 0). This functionality is performed when "secondary-instance-id" is
    configured.

    When 'interface' is used to describe an RLOC instead of "address", the
    system will obtain the first private local address assigned to the 
    device <device-name>. It will typically be translated by a NAT to a global
    address which will be registered to the mapping system. When NAT-traversal
    is not used ("nat-traversal = no"), then the interface address for the
    interface <device-name> will be used as the RLOC. You can have multiple
    "rloc" clauses each referring to a different interface RLOC address.

    When "dynamic-eid" is configured to "yes", the EID-prefix is used to 
    accept the discovery of more-specific EIDs within this prefix range. 
    The configured prefix range is not registered to the mapping system. As 
    more-specific EIDs are discovered, they are registered to the mapping 
    system.

    Note, when the "lisp database-mapping" command clause is used on RTRs
    with no "rloc" clause, the RTR can use different mapping systems based on 
    source-EID and instance-ID. When you use "mr-name" for the prefix entries
    in the "lisp database-mapping" command clause you can direct Map-Requests
    to be sent to the map-resolver that belongs to a specific mapping system.

    When "lisp eid-crypto-hash" is used and IPv6 EIDs are being authenticated,
    an xTR is sending Map-Requests to the mapping system, a "lisp database-
    mapping" command with "signature-eid = yes" is required with a 
    lisp-sig.pem file in the lispers.net directory. This is for xTR originated
    Map-Requests can be signed and verified by the Map-Servers. Note, on an
    RTR, this signature-EID database-mapping does not need to be registered 
    to the mapping system and does not need for this IPv6 EID to be assigned 
    to an system interface device.
   
Example:

#
# Configuring 1 EID-prefix to be registered in instance-ID 1. With two
# active-active RLOCs, each with an RLOC reocrd name to describe where they
# are, topologically. The second database-mapping configures the same RLOC

           Configure the Address of a Map-Server in an ETR
           -----------------------------------------------

lisp map-server {
    ms-name = <map-server-name>
    address = x.x.x.x | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz
    ...
    dns-name = <dns-name>
    ...
    authentication-type = sha1 | sha2
    authentication-key = [<key-id-0-255>]<string>
    encryption-key = [<key-id-0-255>]<string>
    proxy-reply = yes | no
    merge-registrations = yes | no
    refresh-registrations = yes | no
    want-map-notify = yes | no
    site-id = <number>
}
...

Command Description:
    Configures one or more Map-Servers in an ETR. Each command clause  
    configures an additional Map-Server. One clause can configure multiple
    map-server addresses that share all the attributes that follow for the
    clause.
Example:

lisp map-server {
    ms-name = east-coast-map-servers
    address = 1.1.1.1
    address = 2.2.2.2
    authentication-type = sha2
    authentication-key = the-overlay-is-the-only-way
}
lisp map-server {
    address = 2001:1:1:1::1
    authentication-type = sha1
    authentication-key = subnets-suck
}

#
# Encrypt Map-Register message with key-id 3 sent to map-server 3.3.3.3. The
# "lisp encryption-keys" command must have "map-register-key" equal to
#  "[3]differnt-from-auth-key".   
#        
lisp map-server {
    address = 3.3.3.3
    encryption-key = [3]differnt-from-auth-key
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Configure an Explicit Locator Path to be used as an RLOC in the ETR
     -------------------------------------------------------------------

lisp explicit-locator-path {
    elp-name = <name>
    elp-node {
        address = <address>
    	eid = yes | no
    	strict = yes | no
    	probe = yes | no
    }
    ...
}
...

Command Description:
    This configures an Explicit Locator Path that can be used whatever there
    is a RLOC reference in other configuration commands. The order of the
    "elp-path" sub-clauses is the sequence of the encapsulation path in the
    network. It is required that all 4 commands for the elp-node subclause
    are specified.

Example:

lisp explicit-locator-path {
    elp-name = west-to-east
    elp-node {
        address = 1.1.1.1
        strict = no
        probe = no
        eid = no
    }
    elp-node {
        address = 2.2.2.2
        strict = no
        probe = no
        eid = no
    }
    elp-node {
        address = 10.1.1.1
        strict = no
        probe = no
        eid = yes
    }
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Configure a Replication List Entry to be used as an RLOC in an ETR
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

lisp replication-list-entry {
    rle-name = <name>
    rle-node {
        address = <address>
        level = <0-255>
    }
    ...
}
...

Command Description:
    This configures a hierarchical level of multicast RTRs. ITRs will 
    multicast replicate and encapsulate to level-0 RTRs. Level-0 RTRs will
    multicast replicate and encapsulate to level-1 RTRs and so on. The
    highest level RTR will encapsulate to ETRs that join them. This 
    configuration builds a hierarchy or replicating routers but does not
    build a distribution tree. The distribution tree is built with protocol
    signalling.

Example:

lisp replication-list-entry {
    rle-name = att
    rle-node {
        address = 1.1.1.1
        level = 0
    }
    rle-node {
        address = 2.2.2.2
        level = 0
    }
    rle-node {
        address = 11.11.11.11
        level = 1
    }
    rle-node {
        address = 22.22.22.22
        level = 1
    }
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Configure Geo Coordinates to be used as an RLOC in an ETR
         ---------------------------------------------------------

lisp geo-coordinates {
    geo-name = <geo-name>
    geo-tag = <d-m-s-northsouth>-<d-m-s-eastwest>-[<altitude>][/<km>]
}

Command Description: 
    This command configures either a geo-prefix or a geo-point for a  given 
    name. The name is referenced whenever an "rloc" sub-command is used and 
    creates a multi-tuple RLOC to be registered and used in the mapping 
    database system.  The format is in geo-coordinate "DMS" (degrees, minutes,
    seconds, with compass direction) format with a specification for latitude,
    longitude and altitude. When configuring a geo-prefix, the slash format 
    is used as a raduis where the value <km> is in kilometers. So a geo-prefix
    with a geo-coordinate and a radius draws a circle (or sphere when altitude
    is used) for a physical location on earth. So a valid geo coordinate 
    format for Latitude would be "37-11-41-N" and for Longitude would be 
    "121-49-0-W" would be encoded in a "geo-tag" value as "geo-tag = 
    37-11-41-N-121-49-0-W".  The parameter <altitude> is optional and is an 
    integer in units of meters above sea-level. Geo Coordinates encoded as 
    geo-points or geo-prefixes are in LISP LCAF Geo-Coordinate Type format. 
    Note that when this command is configured an ETR will do merge-semantics. 
    Use the parameter "merge-registrations = yes" in the "lisp map-server"
    command.

Example:

lisp geo-coordinates {
    geo-name = a-house-in-san-jose
    geo-tag = 37-11-41-N-121-49-0-W 
}
lisp geo-coordinates {
    geo-name = san-jose
    geo-tag = 37-11-41-N-121-49-0-W/100
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Configure a JSON dictionary array to be used as an RLOC-record in an ETR
   ------------------------------------------------------------------------

lisp json {
    json-name = <json-name>
    json-string = <free-form-json-with-no-delimiters>
}

Command Description: 

Example:

lisp json {
    json-name = contact-info
    json-info = { "name" : "lispers.net", "age" : "old" }
}
lisp database-mapping {
    prefix {
        eid-prefix = 'my-company'
    }
    rloc {
        json-name = contact-info
    }
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Configure a Group Mapping so Source/Group pairs are Registered by an ETR
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

lisp group-mapping {
    group-name = <group-name>
    ms-name = <map-server-name>
    group-prefix = <group-prefix>
    instance-id = <0 - 4294967295>
    rle-address = <rloc-address>
    sources {
        address = <source>
        ...
    }
}

Command Description:
    This command configures what sources should be registered to the mapping
    system for groups contained in <group-prefix> are IGMP/MLD joined. Multiple
    sources can be configured. For the example below, when IGMP joins 
    224.1.1.1, the ETR will register (1.1.1.1, 224.1.1.1) and (2.2.2.2,
    224.1.1.1) to the mapping database system. When no source command clause
    is configured, then a (*,G) entry is registered as (0.0.0.0/0, G) or
    (0::0/0, G).

Example:

lisp group-mapping {
    group-name = 2-sources
    group-prefix = 224.1.1.1/32
    sources {
        address = 1.1.1.1
        address = 2.2.2.2
    }
}
lisp group-mapping {
    group-name = join-star-g
    group-prefix = 224.1.1.1/32
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

                 Configure Gleaning in an RTR
                 ----------------------------

lisp glean-mapping {
    instance-id = <0 - 4294967295> | <low-range-iid>-<high-range-iid>
    eid-prefix = <eid-prefix>
    group-prefix = <group-prefix>
    rloc-prefix = <rloc-prefix>
    rloc-probe = yes | no
}

Command Description:
    This command configures gleaning in an RTR. An RTR will add the source-EID
    and source-RLOC to the map-cache so return packets to the EID can be
    encapsulated to the RLOC. This allows for a xTR to be configured with the
    RTR and not require a control-plane to receive packets. The xTR can be
    behind a NAT or in public space configures 1 or more RTRs to send
    encapsulated packets to and those RTRs will return packets to the xTRs 
    RLOC used in those packets. The RTR will only glean for configured 
    EID-prefixes from RLOCs that are more specific than configured 
    RLOC-prefixes. The "instance-id" parameter can be a range and defaults to 
    0. The parameters "eid-prefix", "group-prefix" and "rloc-prefix" can be
    omitted which defaults to accepting from all. If you configure
    "rloc-probe" then RLOC-probes are sent to the gleaned entry. The default
    value is set to "no".

Example:

#
# When configured on an RTR, the RTR will add any EID that is more specific
# to 35.0.0.0/8 if and only if the source RLOC from received encapsulated
# packets with instance-ID 1000 is more specific than 10.0.0.0/8.
#
lisp glean-mapping {
    instance-id = 1000
    eid-prefix = 10.0.0.0/8
    rloc-prefix = 35.0.0.0/8
}

#
# Glean any EID that has been encapsulated with an instance-id between 1000
# and 2000.
#
lisp glean-mapping {
    instance-id = 1000-2000
    rloc-probe = yes
}

#
# Source RLOC is gleaned when IGMP reports groups in the /16 224.1.0.0 prefix.
#    
lisp glean-mapping {
    instance-id = 1000
    group-prefix = 224.1.0.0/16
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Configure the Address of the DDT root node for a Map-Resolver
        -------------------------------------------------------------

lisp ddt-root {
    address = x.x.x.x | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz
    public-key = <string>
    priority = <0 - 255>
    weight = <0 - 100>
}
...

Command Description:
    Configures the root DDT-node in a Map-Resolver. Multiple command clauses 
    can be used to point to multiple roots.

Example:

lisp ddt-root {
    address = 1.1.1.1
    priority = 1
    weight = 50
}
lisp ddt-root {
    address = 2.2.2.2
    priority = 1
    weight = 50
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          Configure a Static Referral-Cache Entry in a Map-Resolver
          ---------------------------------------------------------

lisp referral-cache {
    prefix {
        instance-id = <0 - 4294967295>
        eid-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
        group-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
    }
    referral {
        address = x.x.x.x | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz
        priority = <0 - 255>
        weight = <0 - 100>
    }
    ...
}
...

Command Description:
    Configures a static referral-cache entry in the Map-Resolver. This is used
    to override referrals received from the DDT system.

Example:

lisp referral-cache {
    prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.1.0.0/16
    }
    referral {
        address = 1.1.1.1
    }
    referral {
        address = 2.2.2.2
    }
}

Command Description:
    Configures a LISP site in a Map-Server. This creates policy in the 
    Map-Server to determine what EID-prefixes can be registered by from which 
    sites with what specific RLOCs.

    Here is a description of each parameter:

    site-name
        Configures a site name for the LISP site entry in a Map-Server.
    
    description
        Configures a free-form string that provides documentation about the
        LISP site.
    
    shutdown
        Configures a single control to determine if the LISP site entry
        is activated or pending operation.
    
    authentication-key = [<key-id-0-255>]<string> ... [<key-id-0-255>]<string>
        Configures one or more keys that must match the authentication-key
        in a Map-Register message. On an ETR, the "authentication-key" command
        of the "lisp map-server" clause must match one of the strings above.
        When multiple keys are used a key-id is require to be specified in
        square brackets.
    
    allowed-prefix
        Multiple allowed-prefix clauses are accepted so parameters can be
        configured differently on a per EID-prefix basis.
    
        instance-id = <0 - 4294967295> | <iid>-<iid>
            Configures either a specific instance-ID that the EID belongs to.
            EIDs that are scoped to instance-IDs are part of the same VPN.
            An instance-ID range can also be specificed and used with the
            "accept-more-specifics" command.
           
 	    eid-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
            Configures any of the lispers.net supported EID types.
    
	    group-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
            Conifgures a multicast group address prefix that can be used with
            the "eid-prefix" command to specific (S,G) multicast state.
    
    	accept-more-specifics = yes | no
            Allows for any Map-Register EID to be accepted for this LISP site
            when it is more specific than the "eid-prefix"/"group-prefix". Or
            when only instance-ID range is specified.
    
	    force-proxy-reply = yes | no
            Configures the Map-Server to send a Map-Reply for this entry rather
            than forwarding the Map-Request to registered RLOCs.
    
 	    force-nat-proxy-reply = yes | no
            Configures the Map-Server to send a Map-Reply for this entry rather
            than forwarding the Map-Request to registered RLOCs when the RLOCs
            are behind NAT devices. When this parameter is configured, a
            conditional Map-Reply is sent. That is, when an ITR sends the
            Map-Request, a list of RTRs is returned. When one of the RTRs
            in the registered RLOC-set sends a Map-Request, then the global
            translated RLOC of the ETR is returned.

        force-ttl = <seconds>
            Configures the TTL value the Map-Server returns in EID-records
            in Map-Replies. Used with the "force ..." parameters.
    
	    echo-nonce-capable = yes | no
            Configures the Map-Server to inform the requesting ITR the RLOC
            can support echo-noncing in the data-plane.

        require-signature = yes | no
            Configures the "allowed-prefix" to have signatures in both
            Map-Register and Map-Request messages for any EID that is being
            registered or requested. Only when signatures are verified that
            the messages are accepted. This is used with the "eid-crypto-hash"
            command. See the command for more details on how to register
            hash->pubkey mappings used for signature verification.
    
	    policy-name = <policy-name>
            Configures the policy defined in the "lisp policy" command clause.

    allowed-rloc
        Multiple allowed-rloc clauses can be configured so EID registrations
        can be further contstrained based on the RLOC which is sending the
        Map-Register message. 
    
        address = x.x.x.x | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
            Configures the IPv4, IPv6, or MAC address that is used and routed
            by the underlay core network. This is a required parameter.
    
        priority = <0 - 255>
            The priority value that must be in the RLOC-record field of the
            Map-Register. This is an optional parameter.
            
        weight = <0 - 100>
            The weight value that must be in the RLOC-record field of the
            Map-Register. This is an optional parameter.
    
Example:

lisp site {
    site-name = cisco-us
    description = EID-prefixes that reside in Cisco US
    authentication-key = us-makes-bad-beer
    allowed-prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.0.0.0/8
        accept-more-specifics = yes
    }
    allowed-prefix {
        eid-prefix = 20.0.0.0/8
    }
}
lisp site {
    site-name = cisco-euro 
    description = EID-prefixes that reside in Cisco Europe
    authentication-key = euro-makes-better-cheese
    allowed-prefix {
        eid-prefix = 20.0.0.0/8
    }
    allowed-prefix {
        eid-prefix = 30.0.0.0/8
    }
    allowed-rloc {
        address = 1.1.1.1
    }
    allowed-rloc {
        address = 2.2.2.2
    }
}
lisp site {
    site-name = an-open-map-server
    description = Accept all registrations that have a common auth-key
    authentication-key = open-secret
    allowed-prefix {
        instance-id = 0
        accept-more-specifics = yes
    }
}

lisp site {
    site-name = multicast
    description = This configuration for supporting signal free multicast
    authentication-key = [0]open-secret [1]closed-secret
    allowed-prefix {
        instance-id = 0
        eid-prefix = 0.0.0.0/0
        group-prefix = 224.0.0.0/4
        accept-more-specifics = yes
    }
    allowed-prefix {
        instance-id = 0
        eid-prefix = 0::/0
        group-prefix = ff::/8
        accept-more-specifics = yes
    }
}

lisp site {
    site-name = crypto-addresses
    description = Authenticate crypto hash based IPv6 EIDs
    authentication-key = open-secret
    allowed-prefix {
        instance-id = 0
        eid-prefix = fd::/8
        accept-more-specifics = yes
    }
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         Configure a Map-Server-Peer in Map-Servers that run LISP-DDT
         ------------------------------------------------------------

lisp map-server-peer {
    prefix {
        instance-id = <0 - 4294967295> | <iid>-<iid>
        eid-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
        group-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
    }
    ...
    peer {
        address = x.x.x.x | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz
        priority = <0 - 255>
        weight = <0 - 100>
    }
    ...
}
...

Command Description:
    This command is configured in each Map-Server so when any of them send
    a Map-Referral they can include the complete set of Map-Servers that is
    being registered to for a given EID-prefix. This allows a complete ms-ack 
    based Map-Referral to be built and returned to the Map-Resolver.

Example:

lisp map-server-peer {
    prefix {
        instance-id = 0
        eid-prefix = 10.1.1.0/24
    }
    peer {
        address = 1.1.1.1
        priority = 1
        weight = 50
    }
    peer {
        address = 2.2.2.2
        priority = 1
        weight = 50
    }
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Configure an Authoritative Prefix in Map-Servers that run LISP-DDT
      ------------------------------------------------------------------

lisp ms-authoritative-prefix {
    instance-id = <0 - 4294967295> | <iid>-<iid>
    eid-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml
    group-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
}
...

Command Description:
    Configures an authoritative prefix for a Map-Server running LISP-DDT. 
    Any parent delegation configuration must be within this prefix. Multiple 
    command clauses can be entered for additional authoriative-prefixes.

Example:

lisp ms-authoritative-prefix {
    eid-prefix = 10.0.0.0/8
}
lisp ms-authoritative-prefix {
    eid-prefix = 2001:0001::/32
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Configure a RTR List that Map-Servers provide to ETRs behind NATs
      -----------------------------------------------------------------

lisp rtr-list {
    address = <rtr-rloc>
    ...
}

Command Description:
    Configures a list of RTRs that a Map-Server returns in Info-Reply
    messages. This is part of the NAT-traversal mechanism used by
    infrastructure LISP components. The RTRs is used by ETRs behind NATs
    to create the necessary state in NAT devices so RTRs can encapsulate
    LISP packets to the ETR.

Example:

lisp rtr-list {
    address = 1.1.1.1     
    address = 2.2.2.2
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        
       Configure Crypto Hash Values for Authenticated IPv6 EID Support
       ---------------------------------------------------------------

lisp eid-crypto-hash {
    instance-id = <0 - 4294967295> | *
    eid-prefix = xxxx:yyyy::/<ml>
}

Command Description:
    Configures the crypto address hash length for any IPv6 EID per instance-ID
    or all instance-IDs when "*" is specified. The value configure is 128
    minus <ml>. The IPv6 "fd::" prefix below will use a 120-bit crypto hash
    and the "2001:5:3::" prefix will use a 80-bit crypto hash. This command is
    required for authenticating both Map-Request and Map-Register message
    signatures. It is required that the mask-length be a multiple of 4 (4-bits
    or 1 nibble) or the command is not accepted.

    Note when signing Map-Requests either originated by an ITR or an RTR, a
    'lisp-sig.pem' file (that contains a private-key) must be present in the
    lispers.net directory and the distinguished-name EID 'hash-<eid-hash>' 
    must be registered to the mapping system with a public-key RLOC-record. 
    When Map-Requests are generated by a lig command, then a lisp-lig.pem file
    must exist. If the same source-EID is being used for lig, then a symbolic
    link for lisp-lig.pem can point to lisp-sig.pem.

Example:

lisp eid-crypto-hash {
    instance-id = 1000
    eid-prefix = fd00::/8
}
lisp eid-crypto-hash {
    eid-prefix = 2001:5:3::/48
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Conifgure Map-Register Encryption Keys on a Map-Server
        ------------------------------------------------------

lisp encryption-keys {
    map-register-key = [<key-id-0-7>]<string> ... [<key-id-0-7>]<string>
}    

Command Description:
    Configures what keys to be used to decrypt a Map-Register message. The
    first bytes of the Map-Register contains a key-id and is not encrypted.
    The rest of the payload is encrypted by a sending ETR. The same key-id
    and password string on this command must match what is configured on the
    "encryption-key" subcommand of the "lisp map-server" command in the ETR.

    By allowing multiple encryption keys, a mapping system can deprovision
    a group of ETRs when it believes it needs to do so. If a packet is
    decrypted incorrectly, it cannot be process and is dropped. A log message
    will be issued in this case.

Example:

#
# Configure 4 key-ids 0 through 4, each with their own decryption password.
# When a Map-Register is received by the Map-Server, the Map-Register key-id
# encoded will determine which configured password should be used.
#        
lisp encryption-keys {
    map-register-key = [0]foo [1]bar [2]group3 [3]group4
}    
    
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Configure an Authoritative Prefix in a LISP-DDT Node
           ----------------------------------------------------

lisp ddt-authoritative-prefix {
    instance-id = <0 - 4294967295> | <iid>-<iid>
    eid-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml
    group-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
}
...

Command Description:
    Configures an authoritative prefix for a DDT-node running
    LISP-DDT. Any parent delegation configuration must be within this prefix. 
    Multiple command clauses can be entered for additional authoriative-
    prefixes.

Example:

lisp ddt-authoritative-prefix {
    eid-prefix = 10.0.0.0/8
}
lisp ddt-authoritative-prefix {
    eid-prefix = 2001:0001::/32
}

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           Configure a EID-Prefix Delegation in a LISP-DDT Node
           ----------------------------------------------------
    
lisp delegation {
    prefix {
        instance-id = <0 - 4294967295> | <iid>-<iid>
        eid-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
        group-prefix = x.x.x.x/ml | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz/ml | xxxx-xxxx-xxxx/ml
    }
    ...
    delegate {
        address = x.x.x.x | xxxx:yyyy::zzzz
        node-type = ddt-child | map-server-child
        public-key = <string>
        priority = <0 - 255>
        weight = <0 - 100>
    }
    ...
}
...

Command Description:
    Configures a child delegation in the LISP-DDT hierarchy. This command is
    entered in a DDT-root node or a DDT-node that is in the middle of the DDT
    hierarchy. This command is not used in a DDT Map-Server. The EID-prefix in 
    this command clause must be more specific than the authoritative-prefix 
    configured on the same system but must be less specific than the 
    authoriative-prefix configured in the child delegation node.

Example:

In parent DDT-node configure:

lisp ddt-authoritative-prefix {
    eid-prefix = 10.0.0.0/8    
}
lisp delegation {
    prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.1.0.0/16
    }
    prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.2.0.0/16
    }
    prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.3.0.0/16
    }
    delegate {
        address = 1.1.1.1
        node-type = ddt-child
    }
    delegate {
        address = 2.2.2.2
        node-type = ddt-child
    }
}
lisp delegation {
     prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.22.0.0/16
    }
    delegate {
        address = 3.3.3.3
        node-type = map-server-child
        priority = 1
        weight = 100
    }
    delegate {
        address = 4.4.4.4
        node-type = map-server-child
        priority = 1
        weight = 100
    }
}

In child delegation (Map-Server 1.1.1.1) for 10.22.0.0/16:

lisp ms-authortiative-prefix {
    eid-prefix = 10.22.0.0/16
}
lisp map-server-peer {
    prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.22.0.0/16
    }
    peer {
        address = 1.1.1.1
        priority = 1
        weight = 100
    }
    peer {
        address = 2.2.2.2
        priority = 1
        weight = 100
    }
}
lisp site {
    site-name = customer1
    authentication-key = customer-private
    allowed-prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.22.1.0/24
    }    
}
lisp site {
    site-name = customer2
    authentication-key = customer-private
    allowed-prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.22.2.0/24
    }    
}
lisp site {
    site-name = customer3
    authentication-key = customer-private
    allowed-prefix {
        eid-prefix = 10.22.3.0/24
    }    
}
lisp site {
    site-name = customer4
    authentication-key = customer-private
    allowed-prefix {
