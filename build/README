This directory is used to build lispers.net images. The script:

    python make-release.py <release-number>

builds a compressed tarball with obfuscated pyo files. The script depends on 
the program pyobfuscate. So it will need to be on your system to build a 
lispers.net tarball.

This script must be run in this build/ directory and depends on peer 
directories docs/ and lisp/. It also depends on a sub-directory called 
py-depend/.

When building a new release, make sure you update the top of build/release-
notes.txt so the lispers.net web page can tell you the notes (new features,
bugfixes, or notes) for the latest release.

The last built release directory will always have a symbolic-link called 
"latest" pointing to it.

The build machine that make-release.py runs on depends on the following tools
to be installed:

    pyflakes
    pyobfuscate

And to build lisp-xtr go binary in the lisp/ directory by doing a:

    ./build-xtr

you need go compiler:

    go version go1.10.4 linux/amd64

and go libraries by doing:

    go get github.com/google/gopacket
    go get github.com/google/gopacket/afpacket
    go get github.com/google/gopacket/layers
    go get github.com/google/gopacket/pcap
    go get golang.org/x/net/bpf

The script:

    python make-apps-release.py

will build a compressed tarball image with all the apps in the apps/ directory.
