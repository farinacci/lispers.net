This directory is used to build lispers.net images. The script:

    python make-release.py <release-number>

builds a compressed tarball with obfuscated pyo files. The script depends on 
the program pyobfuscate. So it will need to be on your system to build a 
lispers.net tarball.

This script must be run in this build/ directory and depends on peer 
directories docs/ and lisp/. It also depends on a sub-directory called 
py-depend/.

When building a new release, make sure you update the top of lisp/release-
notes.txt so the lispers.net web page can tell you the notes (new features,
bugfixes, or notes) for the latest release.

The last built release directory will always have a symbolic-link called 
"latest" pointing to it.

The script:

    python make-apps-release.py

will build a compressed tarball image with all the apps in the apps/ directory.
