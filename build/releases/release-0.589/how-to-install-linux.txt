                  How to Install a lispers.net Release
                  ------------------------------------

The lispers.net LISP subsystem software implements "Routing as an Application".
It runs on Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, and Debian Linux distros as well as MacOS 
and Raspbian. And can run on these platforms in Docker containers. There
are docker images available so you can avoid doing the installation procedures
below.

This implementation is the world's richest feature set of the open IETF LISP 
protocols and interoperates with all modern proprietary and open source 
implementations available today. The implementation supports the data-plane 
components ITR, ETR, and RTR and the control-plane components Map-Resolver, 
Map-Server, and DDT-Node for 10 different EID address types and 7 different 
RLOC address types.

First time install
------------------

(1) For a first-time install, type in the following commands:

    mkdir lispers.net
    cd lispers.net
    sudo tar zxvf <tgz-file>

(2) Follow the apt-get and pip install steps from build/Dockerfile.

(3) Test the install by running this python program:

     python    lispers.net-test-install.pyo   (when running python2)
     python3.8 lispers.net-test-install.pyc   (when running python3)

(4) From a tcsh shell, type in "./RESTART-LISP" when you want to start or 
    restart the LISP subsystem. You can use "sudo ./STOP-LISP" to take the 
    LISP subsystem down. These startup and shutdown scripts require tcsh. 
    You can also restart the LISP subsystem via the web interface.

(5) Open file lisp.config in an editor and configure the LISP functionality you
    desire. You can modify this file anytime after the LISP subsystem is up 
    and running and the changes will be accepted. The header of the file
    will reflect when the file is processed by the LISP subsystem and a diff
    from the last revision will be produced and inserted into the file.

All other times
---------------

(1) From landing page, click the "system status" button.
(2) From a super-user account, click the "install LISP software" button.
(3) Paste in lispers.net tarball URL and click the "Submit" button.
(4) Then click the "restart LISP subsystem" button.

More information
----------------

(1) Open file lisp.config in an editor and configure the LISP functionality you
    desire. You can modify this file anytime after the LISP subsystem is up 
    and running and the changes will be accepted. The header of the file
    will reflect when the file is processed by the LISP subsystem and a diff
    from the last revision will be produced in file lisp.config.diff. You can 
    also use the API to configure functionality. Click the "API Documentation"
    button on the landing page for more details.

(2) You can manage the LISP subsystem by modifying the lisp.config file at
    anytime. You can monitor the LISP subsystem by pointing your browser to 
    the IP address of this system on port 8080. The URL would be:

    https://<address>:8080/lisp

    You will first visit an authentication page. The root user account has no
    password by default. It is suggested you change this to your preferred
    password. All web-based passwords you key in are sent over an SSL 
    connection to an embedded web server. So passwords are never sent in 
    plaintext over the network. What you do next should be self-explanatory 
    from the landing page.

Installation Problems?
----------------------

(1) If you have issues installing pyOpenSSL, try this first and rerun the "pip
    install -r pip-requirements.txt" command from above:

    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev

(2) If you can't find Python.h, try this first and rerun the "pip install
    -r pip-requirements.txt" command from above:

    sudo apt-get install python-dev
    sudo yum install python-devel

(3) If you get this error "unable to execute 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc': No such 
    file or directory", install gcc by typing in:

    sudo apt-get install gcc

(4) If you get this error "fatal error: ffi.h: No such file or directory", 
    install the ffi library and development environment:

    sudo apt-get install libffi-dev

(5) On Debian, if RESTART-LISP/STOP-LISP doesn't seem to work, it's because 
    the processes are not getting killed. The STOP-LISP uses "killall" which
    is not installed by default. Install it by typing in:

    sudo apt-get install psmisc

(6) When lipsers.net-test-install.pyo shows that OpenSSL is not installed, do
    the following:

    sudo pip install pyOpenSSL==16.2.0

(7) On an ubuntu install, if you can't install python modules 'requests' or 
    'geopy', and get the following error when you try to import either:

    File "/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/requests/packages/urllib3/
    contrib/pyopenssl.py", line 43, in <module>
    ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3: OpenSSL.SSL.SSLv3_METHOD,
    AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'PROTOCOL_SSLv3'

    Do the following:

    sudo pip install requests==2.6.0

(8) If you get "pcap_open_live() not found" in your logs/lisp-itr.log file,
    do this:

    sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev

(9) Note that if ip6tables does not work (but is installed), you may need
    to load the IPv6 filter kernel module. Do that with command "sudo
    modprobe ip6table_filter". The symptom that shows when the kernel module
    is not loaded are TCP checksum errors over IPv6.
