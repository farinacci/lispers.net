           How to Download and Install a lispers.net Release
           -------------------------------------------------

There are periodic releases built by support@lispers.net. When they are built
the repo is tagged with the release name and the release tarball is put
in this build/releases/ directory. Symlinks "stable" and "latest" are set so
you can get the flavor of stability you prefer.        

Users are informed about new releases by subscribing to beta@lispers.net.
Send email to request to subscribe, and we will add you.

The release is a single tarball file that you download and untar in your
lispers.net directory. Use this command to untar the release:

    tar zxvf <downloaded-url-file>
    ./RESTART-LISP or ./RL

Note make sure you set an RLOC interface when you call ./RESTART-LISP. For
example on MacOS:

    ./RESTART-LISP 8080 en0

And for example inside of a docker container:

    ./RESTART-LISP 8080 eth0

You can build a wrapper script called RL (see lisp/RL-template to use as
an example for you to copy and modify) so you can tailor it to your system's
physical device interfaces.

You can also use the following script which will download and install the
new release:

    python lisp-get-bits.pyo <url>
    ./RESTART-LISP or ./RL

Make sure there is no "?dl=0", which Dropbox adds, at the end of the URL
before using the script.
