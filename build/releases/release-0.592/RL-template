# RL - Restart LISP Wrapper Script
#
# This is a wrapper script for ./RESTART-LISP. You want to use it to do
# EID address assignment on kernel created interfaces as well as setting
# default and other static route parameters.
#
# Most importantly, you can tell this script where your ./RESTART-LISP script
# is and pass parameters to the script such as the RLOC interface you use.
#
# Put a call to this script in /etc/rc.local so on system startup the LISP 
# subsystem will start automatically. For example, add this line to /etc/rc.
# local:
#
#    /home/<install-directory>/lispers.net/RL || exit 1
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#
# Remove the following lines (including the exit line) after this file has 
# been modified and the script actually does something. Copy it from 
# RL-template to file RL.
#
echo "(1) Type 'cp RL-template RL'"
echo "(2) Customize your RL file"
echo "(3) Remove the echo and exit lines from the top of your RL file"
echo "(4) Use ./RL as a wrapper script for RESTART-LISP"
exit

# -------------------- xTR EID Address Configuration --------------------

#
# If you want to set an EID on the loopback interface for IPv4 and IPv6
# respectively substitute the "x" with meaningful values. 2001:5:3::/48
# is RIPE allocated to lispers.net for IPv6 EID experimentation. Note in
# docker containers, an IPv6 EID MUST NOT be configured on the lo interface
# (on Linux).
#
# Make sure net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 or ICMPv6 echo packets are not
# accepted by kernel. 
#
#sudo ip addr add x.x.x.x/32 dev lo >& /dev/null
#sudo ip addr add x::x/128 dev eth0 >& /dev/null
#sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0

#
# MacOS syntax for configuring addresses. Note 240.0.0.0/4 can be used as
# an EID block. However, on MacOS systems, the kernel will not send packets
# to a 240.x.x.x address. So ping responses and TCP connections won't happen.
# Note client pings and connection initiation can happen from a 240.x.x.x
# address to any EID not in 240.0.0.0/4.
#
#sudo ifconfig lo0 x.x.x.x/32 alias
#sudo ifconfig lo0 inet6 2001:5:3::x/128 alias

# -------------------- Must set MTU on EID Interface --------------------

#sudo ifconfig lo mtu 1400
#sudo ifconfig lo0 mtu 1400

# -------------------- EID Source Address Selection --------------------

#
# If you want to use an EID for all sourced packets, use the src directive.
# Then all apps do not have to do explicit source address selection. The
# EID <eid-from-above> will be used and the lispers.net code will get all
# packets to encap to destinations LISP sites or non-LISP sites.
#
#sudo ip route add default via <default-router> src <ipv4-eid-from-above>
#sudo ip route add 0::/0 via fe80::1 dev eth0 src <ipv6-eid-from-above>

#
# Blackhole routes are useful so packets are not routed by kernel and that
# we can assign the source-EID with the route.
#
#ip route add blackhole <prefix> src <local-eid>

# -------------------- IPv6 Default Route Configuration --------------------

#
# Add default route and next-hop neighbor for IPv6 since it ususally
# doesn't get configured by default.
#
#sudo ip route add 0::/0 via fe80::1 dev eth0
#sudo ip nei add fe80::1 lladdr 0:0:0:0:0:1 dev eth0
#sudo ip nei change fe80::1 lladdr 0:0:0:0:0:1 dev eth0

#
# MacOS syntax for configuring IPv6 default routes.
#
#sudo ndp -s fe80::1%en0 0:0:0:0:0:1
#sudo route add -inet6 0::/0 fe80::1%en0

# -------------------- RTR Specific Configuration --------------------

#
# Note about RTRs that are deployed in cloud providers, which means they
# are behind NATs. You need to configure the global address on the 
# loopback interface since it needs to know to get the ETR's RLOC address 
# from the mapping versus its own address it could mistakenly select as an 
# ETR RLOC because the RTR is comparing its local address to its global 
# address in the mapping, when it isn't the same. So use the commands below
# to start the RTR.
#
# There is also situations where an RTR may supply a private address in an
# RLOC-probe reply. If it is behind a NAT, it needs to supply a global RLOC
# address because if lisp-crypto is being used you want the decap-keys on an
# xTR to reflect the same address that is being used for encapsulation from
# the RTR. So the global address needs to be assignerd to the loopback
# interface and the command line below needs to be "./RESTART-LISP 8080 lo".
#
#sudo ip addr add <rtr-translated-rloc>/32 dev lo >& /dev/null
set RTR_ADDRESS = "<rtr-translated-rloc>"
#sudo ip addr add $RTR_ADDRESS/32 dev lo >& /dev/null

#
# In RTRs doing LISP-NAT, to avoid jumbo frames with DF-bit set (which means
# the RTR would drop packets), we need to disable TCP-segment-offload and
# scatter-gather. Also, lower MSS so there is room for LISP headers for TCP
# packets. In GCP device is ens4 in AWS device is eth0.
#
set DEVICE = "eth0"
#sudo ethtool -K $DEVICE tso off
#sudo ethtool -K $DEVICE sg off
sudo iptables -t mangle -C POSTROUTING -o $DEVICE -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -m tcpmss --mss 1361:1536 -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1360
if ($status == "1") then
#    sudo iptables -t mangle -A POSTROUTING -o $DEVICE -p tcp -m tcp --tcp-flags SYN,RST SYN -m tcpmss --mss 1361:1536 -j TCPMSS --set-mss 1360
endif

# -------------------- LISP Subsystem Startup --------------------

#
# Use this syntax for RESTART-LISP:
#
#     ./RESTART-LISP <web-server-port> <interface:index>
#
# where <web-server-port> is what web-server listens to with SSL (https). If
# you put "-" in front of port, then web-server listens via http. Defaults
# to 8080 but must be specified if <interface:index> is used.
#
# where <interface:index> is the interface to get the RLOC used for sending
# control packets and for encapsulating data packets. If you supply an
# index (starting with value 1 and skip over link-local addresses), you can
# select an address on the interface.
#
# For example:
# 
# ./RESTART-LISP 8080 eth0:3 - uses the 3rd non-link-local address on interface
#                              eth0.
# ./RESTART-LISP 8080 eth0   - uses the 1st non-link-local address on interface
#                              eth0.
#
# The same index is used for both IPv4 and IPv6. So for this interface:

# eth0@if9: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> ...
#     link/ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff link-netnsid 0
#     inet 172.17.0.2/16 brd 172.17.255.255 scope global eth0
#        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
#     inet 1.1.1.1/32 scope global eth0
#        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
#     inet6 2002::2/128 scope global 
#        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
#     inet6 dfdf::1/16 scope global 
#        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
#     inet6 2001::242:ac11:2/16 scope global nodad 
#        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
#     inet6 fe80::42:acff:fe11:2/64 scope link 
#        valid_lft forever preferred_lft forever
# 
# IPv4 index 1 is 172.17.0.2       
# IPv4 index 2 is 1.1.1.1
# IPv6 index 1 is 2002::2
# IPv6 index 2 is dfdf::1
# IPv6 index 3 is 2001::242:ac11:2
#
#
# Start the lispers.net LISP subsystem. Use an absolute path name.
#
#/root/lispers.net/RESTART-LISP 8080 eth0
