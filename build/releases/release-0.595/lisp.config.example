#
# lispers.net lisp.config file, last changed: <sample>
#
# Hostname: <sample>
#
# (1) Only commands between the first pair of dotted lines will be processed. 
#
# (2) Any lines you find prepended with "#>>>" are errors found during command 
#     processing.
#
# (3) You may comment out lines by placing a "#" in the first column of any 
#     line between the section between the first pair of dotted lines.
#
# (4) Note the hostname and modification timestamp above are auto generated
#     after you have saved this file and it has been processed.
#
# (5) Deleting configuration can be achieved by deleting lines and restarting
#     the LISP component or by use of the LISP API.
#
# (6) The landing web page on any device provides detailed Command and API
#     documentation. Just click on those buttons.
#
# (7) Any name references must follow their definitions. Examples are 
#     elp-names and rle-names when referred to in static map-cache entries.
#
# DO NOT REMOVE THE LINES "#--- ... ---" and "#--- ... ---#".
#
# DO NOT email lisp.config files because mailers will insert \r\n rather
# than keeping this file with \n only.
